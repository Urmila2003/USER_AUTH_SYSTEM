# USER_AUTH_SYSTEM

This Django authentication system allows users to register for an account, log in, log out, and confirm their email address. Upon successful registration, users receive an email with a confirmation link to verify their email address. Once the user has confirmed their email, they can log in to their account and access their dashboard. This project uses Django's built-in authentication system and Django-allauth to implement email confirmation.
